Written in C# with the ASP.NET Framework.\r\n\r\n### By Jo Ann Brooks\r\n#### NSS Cohort 7 Graduate\r\n\r\nThe Pickers Tunes REST API supports CRUD and Search operations on a database of Bluegrass Tunes.\r\n\r\nBased on REST principles, the API supports URL access via the browser and interaction with almost any HTTP client in any programming language.  Thus it enables writing and testing different front ends for the basic application.\r\n\r\n## Base URL\r\n\r\nAll URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:\r\n\r\n> `https://api.pickerstunes.azure.microsoft.com/`\r\n\r\nSubresources\r\n\r\nTwilio Accounts have the following subresources. Click on a link to read the API documentation for accessing or modifying each resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n## REST:  REpresentational State Transfer [from Wikipedia.org]\r\n\r\n### Architectural constraints\r\nThe architectural properties of REST are realized by applying specific interaction constraints to components, connectors, and data elements. The formal REST constraints are:\r\n\r\n#### Client–server\r\nA uniform interface separates clients from servers. This separation of concerns means that, for example, clients are not concerned with data storage, which remains internal to each server, so that the portability of client code is improved. Servers are not concerned with the user interface or user state, so that servers can be simpler and more scalable. Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface between them is not altered.\r\n\r\n#### Stateless\r\nThe client–server communication is further constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests. Each request from any client contains all the information necessary to service the request, and session state is held in the client. The session state can be transferred by the server to another service such as a database to maintain a persistent state for a period and allow authentication. The client begins sending requests when it is ready to make the transition to a new state. While one or more requests are outstanding, the client is considered to be in transition. The representation of each application state contains links that may be used the next time the client chooses to initiate a new state-transition.\r\n\r\n#### Cacheable\r\nAs on the World Wide Web, clients can cache responses. Responses must therefore, implicitly or explicitly, define themselves as cacheable, or not, to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests. Well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client–server interactions, further improving scalability and performance.\r\n\r\n#### Layered system\r\nA client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load balancing and by providing shared caches. They may also enforce security policies.\r\n\r\n#### Code on demand (optional)\r\nServers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by the transfer of executable code. Examples of this may include compiled components such as Java applets and client-side scripts such as JavaScript. \"Code on demand\" is the only optional constraint of the REST architecture.\r\n\r\n#### Uniform interface\r\nThe uniform interface constraint is fundamental to the design of any REST service.[3] The uniform interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently. The four constraints for this uniform interface are:\r\n##### Identification of resources\r\nIndividual resources are identified in requests, for example using URIs in web-based REST systems. The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are returned to the client. For example, the server may send data from its database as HTML, XML or JSON, none of which are the server's internal representation, and it is the same one resource regardless.\r\n##### Manipulation of resources through these representations\r\nWhen a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource.\r\n##### Self-descriptive messages\r\nEach message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. For example, which parser to invoke may be specified by an Internet media type (previously known as a MIME type). Responses also explicitly indicate their cacheability.\r\n###### Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)\r\nClients make state transitions only through actions that are dynamically identified within hypermedia by the server (e.g., by hyperlinks within hypertext). Except for simple fixed entry points to the application, a client does not assume that any particular action is available for any particular resources beyond those described in representations previously received from the server.\r\nOne can characterise applications conforming to the REST constraints described in this section as \"RESTful\". If a service violates any of the required constraints, it cannot be considered RESTful.\r\n\r\nComplying with these constraints, and thus conforming to the REST architectural style, enables any kind of distributed hypermedia system to have desirable emergent properties, such as performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.\\\\\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
